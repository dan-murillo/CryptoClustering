## Overview of the Analysis

In this repository you will find how an unsupervised learning Machine Learning model was applied to cluster cryptocurrencies. The purpose of the analysis was to find the best way to cluster such currencies and to evaluate how inertia and the number of features affect the analysis.

The data was prepared for the analysis, and the following method was run twice:
- Creating a ```Pandas``` DataFrame with the data to be analysed, finding the best value for 'k', clustering the cryptocurrencies with K-means, and plotting the results.

It was run twice because two different datasets were used: first, the original dataset, and second, the same dataset, but optimised with a PCA analysis.

## Q&As

1. Question: What is the best value for k? Answer: It seems to be 4.

2. Question: What is the total explained variance of the three principal components? Answer: About 89.50%.

3. Question: What is the best value for k when using the PCA data? Answer: It's still 4.

4. Question: Does it differ from the best k value found using the original data? Answer: No, it doesn't.

5. Question: After visually analyzing the cluster analysis results, what is the impact of using fewer features to cluster the data using K-Means? Answer: The inertia decreased and the data points seem to be less dispersed. Having fewer features to cluster the data seems to reduce ambiguity, which leads to a better interpretation of the results.
